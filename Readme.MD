# Two-Wheeled Self-Balancing Robot (TWSBR)

## Overview
This repository contains the files and codes that I wrote as part of the Bot Brains Round 2

## Features you can learn from these files
- Balance control using IMU (MPU6050)
- Motor control using L298N motor driver
- GPS-based navigation
- Obstacle detection using LiDAR
- Parcel handling using a robotic arm with a gripper

## Components
- Raspberry Pi
- MPU6050 IMU
- L298N Motor Driver
- GPS Module
- LiDAR Sensor
- Robotic Arm with Gripper
- Motors and Wheels
- Power Supply

## Setup
1. Connect the sensors and actuators to the Raspberry Pi as per the circuit diagram.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip`:
3. Run the main program:


## Files
- `PART A, B and C.pdf`: Contains The first 3 parts of the answers.
- `Part D.pdf`: Contains calculations, ideation ,theory, diagrams and references.
- `homeSecuritySystem`: Contains C++ code for an Home Security System that I had to fill in the missing lines of code and debug it a bit. 

## Ideation
This project integrates a modular parcel handling system with advanced sensor fusion and control algorithms to create a versatile and efficient delivery robot.
