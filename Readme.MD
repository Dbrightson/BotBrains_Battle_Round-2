# Two-Wheeled Self-Balancing Robot (TWSBR)

## Overview
This project involves designing and programming a Two-Wheeled Self-Balancing Robot (TWSBR) capable of autonomous navigation and parcel handling.

## Features
- Balance control using IMU (MPU6050)
- Motor control using L298N motor driver
- GPS-based navigation
- Obstacle detection using LiDAR
- Parcel handling using a robotic arm with a gripper

## Components
- Raspberry Pi
- MPU6050 IMU
- L298N Motor Driver
- GPS Module
- LiDAR Sensor
- Robotic Arm with Gripper
- Motors and Wheels
- Power Supply

## Setup
1. Connect the sensors and actuators to the Raspberry Pi as per the circuit diagram.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip`:
3. Run the main program:
